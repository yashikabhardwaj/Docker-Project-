Use any OS and inside that OS you should have to installed docker software.
always stop firewall
systemctl stop firewalld

to check docker services
systemctl start docker systemctl status docker

for checking container
docker ps & docker ps -a

install httpd package
yum install httpd

then move to html
cd /var/www/html

check their any file exits or not
ls

then create a file
vi index.html

write your program in index.html
create another file called Dockerfile
vim Dockerfile

write your code
create an image from Dockerfile
docker build -t xyz .

launch the container
docker run -d --name work -p 80:80 xyz

Thank You
